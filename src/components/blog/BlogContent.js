                    <div className="para_sec">
                        <p>As the monsoon winds dance through the fields and the skies shower their blessings, a deeper kind of nourishment begins too—not just for the earth, but for the soul. This sacred period marks the arrival of Shravana Maas in North India, a highly auspicious month in the Hindu calendar. Revered as the dearest month to Lord Shiva, Shravana brings with it a wave of devotion, fasting, spiritual practices, and divine alignment.</p>
                        <p>In this holy month, devotees across India turn inward-toward silence, towards simplicity, Alignment with spiritual self, Moskh and above all, towards Shiva, the eternal yogi, the cosmic stillness behind all creation.</p>

                        <p>Shravana is not just a month-it’s a spiritual season. Here’s why this month is held in such high esteem: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>• Mythological Significance: It is believed that during the Samudra Manthan (churning of the ocean), Lord Shiva drank the halahala (deadly poison) to save the world. This event is commemorated in Shravana, and devotees worship him to express gratitude. </li>
                            <li>• Vibrational Alignment: The cosmos, during this time, supports deeper spiritual practices. Mantras, prayers, and austerities have amplified effects. </li>
                            <li>• Shiva’s Favourite Time: Mondays (Somvars) in this month are believed to be especially blessed. Many fast on these days and visit Shiva temples to offer milk, water, and bel leaves to seek his Blessings.</li>
